  seed: 1
  n_reads: 5
  reduce_memory: false

reads__trimming__cutadapt:
  # 1st stage - trimming
  cut_from_start_r1: null # OPT - removes a specified number of bases from the beginning of the R1 read.
  cut_from_start_r2: null # OPT - removes a specified number of bases from the beginning of the R2 read.
  cut_from_end_r1: null # OPT - removes a specified number of bases from the end of the R1 read.
  cut_from_end_r2: null # OPT - removes a specified number of bases from the end of the R2 read.
  quality_cutoff_from_5_end_r1: 20 # cutoff on 5' end of R1 read. The second step.
  quality_cutoff_from_3_end_r1: 20 # cutoff on 3' end of R1 read. The second step.
  quality_cutoff_from_5_end_r2: 20 # cutoff on 5' end of R2 read. The second step.
  quality_cutoff_from_3_end_r2: 20 # cutoff on 3' end of R2 read. The second step.
  nextseq_trimming_mode: false # Modify quality-trimming algorithm to expect two-color chemistry data (NextSeq). This masks G bases to zero quality for R1 3'. Thus, `quality_cutoff_from_3_end_r1` must be defined.
  do_adapter_removal: false
  shorten_to_length: null # OPT - both R1 and R2 are shortened to this length.
  trim_N_bases_on_ends: false # OPT - trim flanking N's on both read ends.
  min_length_r1: null # OPT - minimum R1 read length. If R1 read is shorter, both R1 and R2 reads are discarded. The fourth step.
  min_length_r2: null # OPT - minimum R2 read length. If R2 read is shorter, both R1 and R2 reads are discarded. The fourth step.
  max_length_r1: null # OPT - maximum R1 read length. If R1 read is longer, both R1 and R2 reads are discarded. The fourth step.
  max_length_r2: null # OPT - maximum R2 read length. If R2 read is longer, both R1 and R2 reads are discarded. The fourth step.
  max_n_bases: 5 # OPT - Discard read if R1 or R2 has more than the specified number of N bases. The fifth step.
  max_expected_errors: null # OPT - Discard read if R1 or R2 has more expected errors than this.
